## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
ggplot(myData, aes(Sessions)) + geom_histogram()
```

In this case I utilized a histogram plot to demonstrate the number of sessions an individual bill represented in the data had gone through. I considered using a scatter plot or a violin plot but found that this was likely the best course of action in determining information from the data, particularly finding topics where efficacy of bureaucracy is a problem. Thus far I have found this dataset rather vast for any simplistic visualization to be sufficient for my likings and would like to break the data into multiple datasets by year.
